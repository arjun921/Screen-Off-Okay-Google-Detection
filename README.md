# Screen-Off-Okay-Google-Detection
A simple app that enables screen off okay google detection on devices that do not support off-screen hotword detection

This app intends to enable completely screen off okay google detection. It mimics the phone status as charging, although it really isn't. By making the phone think that it is charging, we can evoke "Okay google" touchless control. 

Of course, now with great power comes great responsibility.

All those cool features of Moto X and some nexus/pixel devices that do support Off Screen okay google detection because of special hardware being present to detect voice in sleep mode, yes you could have it. Although at one cost. Battery.

Test Device: Redmi Note 4(Snapdragon 3GB Variant)

Now with the battery being a large 4100 mAH combined with a highly power efficient Snapdragon 625, I could manage to get through a day and more until I reached 25% of my battery.

**Doze will no longer work, so as long as you're okay you can proceed with the installation of this app.** 

Battery Life varies from device to device, please test and report back.
